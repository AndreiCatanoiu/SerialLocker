## Required Hardware

- **ESP8266**, **ESP32**, or another compatible microcontroller
- Serial communication module (e.g., USB-TTL, RS485, standard UART)
- Electronic lock or other security device
- Additional components (LEDs, buzzer, relays, etc.)

---

## Required Software

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- ESP board support (follow the instructions in the [ESP8266 documentation](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or [ESP32 documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html))
- Other libraries specified in the code (check the `libraries.txt` file or inline documentation if available)
